R package designed for input-output analysis, emphasizing usability for Excel users and performance. It includes an RStudio Addin and a suite of functions for straightforward import of input-output tables from Excel, either programmatically or directly from the clipboard.

The package is optimized for speed and efficiency. It leverages the R6 class for clean, memory-efficient object-oriented programming. Furthermore, all linear algebra computations are implemented in Rust to achieve highly optimized performance.
