Python from R is a collaborative initiative to write a book to help experienced R users learn Python. In the words of my boi [Benjamin Wolfe](https://twitter.com/BenjaminWolfe) in the Python from R Slack channel:

>- We’re a group of people who either learned Python from R, are R users currently learning Python, or have yet to learn Python, but are comfortable with R.
- What we hope to do is write some collaborative resources for others like ourselves to find their way more easily.
- We will work in the open, for anyone “out there” to find and benefit from (and collaborate on!) along the way.
- In the end, we envision this looking like a book — whether that means a literal, physical, published print book, or an online one.

# MOTIVATION

When I was writing my concept map for the book (we'll write about it eventually), it crossed my mind an analogy about learning a foreign language: *it's impossible to learn a new language by translating word by word*. It's not only a matter of vocabulary. I mean, each language has it's own grammar, phrasal verbs, diction, expressions, pace etc. That kind of issue also appears when learning a new *programming language* and I think importing packages is a good, yet very simple, example of that.

# CALLING A FUNCTION FROM A PACKAGE

In R, every package installed in the active library site is listed whenever a R terminal is open. Those listed packages are available for users at all times. For example:

```{r echo = FALSE}

blogdown::shortcode("highlight", "r", .content = '
# search for machine learning measures that contais "AUC" in the {mlr3} package
mlr3::mlr_measures$keys("auc")')
```

But that way of calling functions usually take place only if that particular package won't be required very often. Otherwise, a `library()` call is expected.

```{r echo = FALSE}

blogdown::shortcode("highlight", "r", .content = "
mtcars |>
  ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(x = hp, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +
  ggplot2::geom_point()

")
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

mtcars |>
  ggplot(aes(x = hp, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point()
```

# PACKAGES LOCATION

In R, users usually have one or maybe two (default and a custom one) library sites. Those can be accessed via `.LibPaths()`. In my case:

```{r}

# packages site locations
.libPaths()
```
