I work in credit risk modeling and data science in general at Banco do Estado do Espírito Santo (\@Banestes_SA), where I have been employed since 2008. My focus is on improving information quality and reducing decision-making uncertainty through statistical methods and experimentation. I am an economist (Federal University of Espírito Santo - UFES, 2014) and mathematician (Federal Institute of Espírito Santo, 2024) by training, and I became a data scientist out of affinity.

I am a doctoral student in the Graduate Program at the Federal University of Espírito Santo (PPGEco/UFES), where I also completed my master's degree. My research field is time series econometrics, specifically hierarchical time series and machine learning methods for hierarchical time series forecasting.

Regarding technologies, I am an enthusiast of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) and primarily use R, Rust, and Python in my projects. I do not use a single OS and am always switching between macOS, Linux Ubuntu, and Linux Fedora at home, and Windows at work. I am the author of the [fio](https://albersonmiranda.github.io/fio/) package, which is a tool for input-output matrix analysis -- perfectly combining my background in economics, mathematics, and computing.

In my free time, I enjoy surfing, playing guitar, and producing music in my home studio.
